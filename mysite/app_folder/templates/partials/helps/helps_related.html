      <p>This page demonstrates the concept of "word embeddings" in a novel context, recruitment.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Rather than returning synonyms, the results returned are words that were found to be used in similar contexts
      as your lookup word.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Take, for instance, "mongodb". This database software takes the "NoSQL" approach. This is one of many fundamental difference that divide database technologies. </p>
      <br>
      <p>If we were to quantify the "relatedness" of say, "mongodb" to "MS SQL Server" and "Apache Cassandra", "Apache Cassandra" should score higher than "MS SQL Server" as these are both "NoSQL".</p>
      <br>
      <p>Some services attempt to the same quantification through correlation, which can lead your search in the wrong direction.
